# MAProper
This crate provides the cleaning memory allocator `MAProper` üßπ


## What is `MAProper`
`MAProper` is an extension around `std::alloc::System` which ensures that the allocated memory
is always erased before it is deallocated by using one of
`memset_s`/`SecureZeroMemory`/`explicit_bzero`/`explicit_memset`.


## Whats the purpose of `MAProper`
`MAProper` becomes handy if you're dealing with a lot of sensitive data: because the memory
management of dynamically allocating types like `Vec` or `String` is opaque, you basically have
no real chance to reliably erase their sensitive contents.

However they all use the global allocator ‚Äì so all ways lead to Rome (or in this case to the
global allocator's `alloc` and `dealloc` functions) ‚Äì which is where `MAProper` is sitting and
waiting to take care of the discarded memory.


## Using `MAProper` as global allocator (example)
```rust
#[global_allocator]
static MA_PROPER: MAProper = MAProper;

fn main() {
	// This `Vec` will allocate memory through `MA_PROPER` above
	let mut v = Vec::new();
	v.push(1);
}
```


## Important
Please note that `MAProper` only erases memory that is deallocated properly. This especially
means that:
 - stack items are __not overwritten__ by this allocator (therefore we expose `MAProper::erase`
   or `MAProper::erase_ptr<T>` so that you can erase them manually if necessary)
 - depending on your panic-policy and your `Rc`/`Arc` use (retain-cycles), the destructor (and
   thus the deallocator) may never be called

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha-Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
This crate is in an early alpha state; so be careful and don't rely on it if you haven't checked
it by yourself!
